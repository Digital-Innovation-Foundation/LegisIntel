# Legislative Intelligence (LegisIntel)

Legislative Intelligence (LegisIntel) is a research project to develop a number of open-source Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph apps, e.g., annotate debates; monitor legislative events; customize info to citizen; multi-agent search; etc. 

## Definitions
The term “Legislative Intelligence” refers to any Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, ranging from machine learning to semantic reasoning to multi-agent systems, that can support Elected Members and their legal teams in researching the complex interrelations, and test the relevance and consistency between, the variety of national and international laws, regulations, reports, and debates.

## Objectives
1. Focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Semantic Matching using Ontologies, Business Rules Engines (BRE), and Knowledge Graphs (KG) used in NoSQL and Big Data databases. 
2. Optimize end-user experience and Human-Machine Interactions for several groups by ensuring customizable profiles as per their configurable specific interests. 
3. Integrate heterogenous information sources and help better identify the various concepts and entities throughout texts. 
4. Index the key sentences and summaries through their own custom knowledge base. 
5. Recommend relevant text excerpts they can build upon as a team, and possibly compose and customize legislations that have been thoroughly tested for coherence and accuracy. 
6. Ensure greater democratic participation by allowing end-users to customize their experience.

## Data
Open data published by Parliamentary, Congressional, and other Legislative institutions take many forms. 

The best known are related to Elected Members and other participants: profiles and interventions, witness, and visitors, transcribed and translated debates, voting history of Elected Members. 

Another dataset relates to parliamentary operations: agendas and schedules of chambers and committees, directories of laws and regulations at various stages of development. 

The last and most complex would be major documents submitted and processed by parliamentarians: reports and investigations by external entities, public accounts and auditor general analysis.

## Functionality
1. semantic annotations
2. semantic search
3. automatic summarization
4. automatic translation
5. automatic recommendation
6. topic-based monitoring
7. jurisdiction-based monitoring
8. public accounts analytics
9. interface design and data exploration
10. collaborative annotation and analysis

## End-User Groups
End-user groups have different needs, where a core set of technologies (1-5 listed previously) are important to all groups, while others (6-10) are more specific to certain groups. Here is how groups share certain similarities: 

Groups 1 and 2 are more concerned with in-depth and legal substance of parliamentary decisions.

Groups 3, 4 and 5 have more concerns across a wide range of policies, events, and interventions in parliamentary proceedings.

Groups 6 and 7 are the more numerous but have a more punctual yet regular need for information “push” mostly through customizable alerts.

1. _Legislative Professionals_: Researching the complex interrelations, and test the relevance and consistency between, the variety of laws and regulations.
2. _Public Policy Analysts_: Government executives and their analysts concerned by parliament proceedings touching on their policies and programs.
3. _Municipal Officials_: Analyzing financial and service implications across a wide range of policies and ensuring a coherent response to jurisdiction Elected Members.
4. _Public Interest Groups_: Monitoring upcoming laws and regulations, pinpointing potential implications, aligning their messages with key Elected Members, and lobbying.
5. _Investigative Journalists_: Journalists primarily of print media seeking detailed analyses on key topics, especially raising significant evidence and testimony.
6. _Political News Reporters_: Journalists of all media channels in need to stay in touch and ensure accuracy of latest political news and their potential impact.
7. _Informed Citizens_: Academics, students, activists, politicians, etc., receiving alerts of new events related to topics and jurisdictions of their concerns.
